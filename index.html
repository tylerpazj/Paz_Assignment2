<p> Bedford-Stuyvesant has a higher than city-rate of residents who utilize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as SNAP. SNAP recipients use the Electronic Benefit Transfer, a system that allows participants to purchase food. Pulling numbers from New York City Open Data shows that about a third of all residents are enrolled in the aforementioned programs. In fact, between Sept. 2023 to Sept. 2024, the number of households that received SNAP consultations grew by approximately 4%. </p>
